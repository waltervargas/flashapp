## Introduction
Flashapp is, for now, an idea of build a community-driven flashcard [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)
application.

### What is ready?
Just this readme file, and a set of [questions](https://github.com/waltervargas/flashapp/issues) about design and architecture.

### Why? 
Paper [Flashcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard) have been used since at least the 19th century,
is the main tool behind [Spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) learning technique,
Since learning is a fundamental process for the future of our society, I believe that in society we can 
build this tool in support of the learning process.
